Workshop on mathematical data

OpenDreamKit, ODK, Cernay

2019-08-18 -- afternoon -- introductions

[Katja]

Welcome everyone.

Thanks for coming and humouring what used to be my pet project
and after growing beyond my expectations is now a group effort,
and I'm really happy about that.

We're going to talk about math data, and figure out how we can improve things.

Logistics

- we'll cook our own food; for each meal we need volunteers for 3 roles:
  main cook; help cook; set up and clean up table
- please join the github repo for the workshop;
  it has links to other workshop related things
- Erik, Julian, Samuel know the place well, ask them practical questions
- general idea of the workshop
  - work on things, in relaxed way, in all sizes of groups
  - brief plenary 10:00 daily, to plan work and groups for the day
  - status report before dinner each evening
  - please say things like "hey everyone at 2pm I'll demo this or that"
  - dinner usually planned for 19:00 but typically happens at 20:00 or 21:00
- Katja's hopes for this week, see readme, please expand
  - user stories
  - we're building a system, that Tom just refactored and made better
    - import datasets into it
    - abstract polytopes / maniplexes, Gabe
    - lattices, Jukka
    - small groups library, Michael Torpey
  - all these datasets consist of a list of objects and a list of properties
    - balance implementation simplicity, importance to mathematicians
    - describe the theories
      - ...
      - formalisation aspects
      - Dennis + Florian will help with formalisation related things

[Samuel goes pick up Michael Torpey and misses most of the introductions;
please everybody write something here if you want]

- Erik Bray
  software engineer
  undergrad in CS at UMass Amherst
  working as software engineer for OpenDreamKit the last 3.5 years
  primarily for Sage, a little bit for GAP
  lots of software engineering experience
  web dev, backend stuff, frontend stuff
  can help with a lot of things
  not any stakes in the workshop goals, but sympathetic to them
  and here to help in whatever way I can

- Michael Torpey
  University of St Andrews
  started undergrad there 2009
  blackhole of academia, sucked into it
  in the last year since i ...
  working for OpenDreamKit
  memoisation in GAP and Python systems
  to start with, made "pypersist",
  a Python library for caching stuff to disk or databases online
  tested out by a couple of people
  since then been developing analogous thing for GAP
  possibly share between GAP and Python program
  this week, i'm hoping even today:
  make a release of this GAP package that has reached enough maturity
  i'd like to explore ideas
  OpenDreamKit ends at the end of August and from 01 September 2019
  i'll be associate lecturer, education-focused, in St Andrews;
  since it'll be education-focused, I might be writing less software,
  so this week hoping to wrap up software in various ways,
  to say "this is what I did in my year as a software engineer"
  [Someone asks] are you in the same department as Peter Cameron?
  [Michael] I go to the pub with Peter Cameron every week, but don't
  work with him; he's in the school of math i'm in the cs school

- Samuel Lelièvre
  - research and teaching mathematician at Orsay
  - I like to make lists, to classify, to organise
  - I am subscribed to a lot of mailing lists

- Michael Kohlhase
  Primož Potočnik, one of the organisers, couldn't make it here;
  has been banding about the idea of having a journal of math data,
  or math datasets
  - if we had a system like the one we're dreaming of,
    this could be a way to combine a repository of datasets,
    together with a way of making academic reputation
  - the people who are usually going to do these datasets have to publish
  - Primož's idea, I've been part of these kind of things,
    never kind of worked in other communities as well
  - people like me should advise young people to not invest in
    dataset libraries, software, because they're not going to get credit;
    so either discourage it and do only theory
    or make it so people can get academic credit out of it

  - I'm convinced this can be done, we need a variety of personal resources
    - mathematicians with good standing in the field who can become guardian angels
    - people who can provide hosting, so we can point to some landing page
    - people who are actually willing to review datasets; seems to be the biggest hurdle
      - if we can't review it, a journal will go haywire
      - if we can, i'm sure we can pull this off
    - it seems to me quite a few potential reviewers are sitting around this table
      so just wanted to put this thing up in the air

- [Jukka] oeis website and database, + journal of integer sequences 
- [Michael K] likewise we have the mizar library, and the journal of formalized mathematics
- [Gabe] sanitize datasets; I happen to know from working with these things
- [Michael K] bipartite submissions: paper that says I did this in that, and dataset
- [Michael K] I can't be the person really driving this; I see myself as a partial facilitator
  - we would need a couple of people who are behind this idea
    and who are willing to make an initial editorial board
  - make this an online open-access thing
  - openmath society could facilitate that and give it an institutional home
  - technical infrastructure
    - general lets-make-a-journal
    - database
  - community willing to commit to 2 years of reviewing until there are ~ 20 articles
    so people know this exists
  - we need a few people to write articles, others to review

[Gabe] Ars mathematica contemporanea is my favourite journal
the journal of "stuff that Tomasz Poznański likes"
[Katja] it's online, open-access, has a good index

[Jukka] in my job I have teaching duties; the rest of the time they are quite happy
if I do community service

[Michael K] Guardian angels might not have the time to take care of it
but might have enought time and be willing to advertize it.
They will only get involved if there is a credible set of people who promise
to do 2 years of work.
To start a journal, you need ~ 10 articles to get you past the first 6 months.

Reviewing of datasets must exist in other disciplines.

[Samuel] there is a journal called "Rescience" dedicated to reproducibility

[Michael K] We can require that code is provided.

[Julian]
mathematicians are extremely reluctant to share their code,
just because they are terribly ashamed of it

[Julian]
the way the arxiv does it is you need to be whitelisted by someone for some subject area

[Jukka]
the oeis way is you can publish or just submit data;
it's good to have things loose enough

[Gabe]
Some mathematicians keep semi-public datasets, eg research by PhD students

[Michael]
you could also have a public escrow; let something host the data, keeping it private,
and it goes public unlicensed if you stop pressing the button to keep it private

[Julian]
what license

[Michael K]
- i would go for CC licences, eg CC-BY
- you could have something like access control
- eg I have arxiv data in xml, i'm not allowed to make it public,
  but I have a cooperative for math data linguistics
  where members of this cooperative can get access
- [someone asks] can anyone put copyright on mathematical truths?
- [MK] mathematical truths might not be copyrightable,
  but the expression of the mathematical truths are copyrighable

-----
[Katja]
- my phd advisor was generating lists of objects,
  and storing things in text files, either as csv text files,
  or maple code that produces the objects
- I thought that was sad and you should have a database
- I had 3 pieces of knowledge that I thought were good to have for a simple thing
  - knew about coding a website
  - knew about the math
  - knew about databases
- fast-forward 5 years, and I've convinced a few people that this stuff was cool;
  mathematicians produce data (you know that)
- to produce data, you need to say what kind of data 
  we've called it concrete data, relational data; not happy with either name
  either too general or doesn't communicate well
  so if you come up with a good name we'll be happy
- the data we'll be interested in covering
  - table, has list of edge-transitive graphs in the first column
  - more columns give group size, stabilizer size, and more properties
  - each atomic datum is a "concrete mathematical object"
    (as opposed to "a paragraph of text", or "an algorithm to compute the value")
[Gabe]
- what about families of discrete objects with some number of parameters
[Katja]
- one thing we think characterizes the kind of objects we want to make databses of
  is "representation theorems"; can label each object canonically
  - eg small integers between -100 and 100
- in OEIS, sometimes you have a closed formula for the whole sequence
[MK]
- very often we have representation theorems,
  even though we might not think of them as such
  - we distinguish "concrete data" and "symbolic data"
  - some infinite graphs can be represented as finite objects
  - you can also have symbolic data collections
  - theorem prover libraries are datasets of symbolic data;
    they are very different in nature; what they talk about can be all over the map
  - there's also "metadata": who published what; how does that relate to other things
  - "narrative data": math papers; the names we give things;
    while "the Petersen graph" might be defining to some people,
    but other people can 
  - we believe all four types of data

[Katja]
- famous mathematician Coxeter finds a graph he finds interesting;
  asks a colleague if this graph has been studied before; colleague answers
  "yes, we call it the Coxeter graph, there's a paper by you about it"!

- develop a description language that lets us use the description to
  - on one hand, describe the dataset enough so that the system
    can take that description and generate the database part and frontend part for it
  - on the other hand, ontology, math-in-the-middle

- there's a few things this description can contain
  - provenance (useful to have) and metadata about the collection
  - info on how the information can be stored, and what the information is
  - ...

[Michael K]
- integers can be encoded in various ways
- in many databases, it wasn't clear what the encoding was
- codecs are a way of systematising that
- elliptic curves
- "at the mathematical level"
- separate the database level from the math level
  - John Cremona or Neil Sloane
    know the 
    they don't quite see that there are software engineering decisions
    that have to be retaken after a while
    in math you get strong by confusing representation level and object
    whereas in cs you get strong by not confusing them
  - in math, every sorting algorithm is the same: same input, same output
  - in cs, you care about complexity
- having databases
- even things as lmfdb where they have invested person-centuries
  if you want some data, you write an email to John Cremona asking
  "please can you give me the list of ..."
  - the mathematicians who have sufficient cs background to understand
    the difference between representation and object
  - the computer scientists who understand that they are the same

- one thing I would like to add to this 
  FAIR = "findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable"
  - findable: search engines: we don't have them
  - accessible: sometimes... many datasets are in laptops in the attic
  - interoperable: have not seen one
  - reusable: not seen one
  That's not up to snuff!!
  Those things we need to do somehow, and establish a standard!
  The field is open. Just by doing something that works allows us
  to set the standard.

[Andrea] the system already has an editor for codecs?
[Michael] it's called Emacs

[Tom]
- rough overview
- the system is built based on Django on the backend (it's a web framework)
- the database SQLite, tested on Postgres as well
- client side, using React.js, modern client-side framework written in JavaScript
- declare your set of codecs by saying "this codec uses database integers"
- "data in this codec is displayed to the user like that"
- react component, html, css, mathml, png, ... anything displayable in a web browser
- each codec has exactly one representation; you can have several codecs
- each codec additionally has information about what kind of queries it supports
- codecs in some way hide part of the query language

[Michael K]
- assumption: there will be ~100 codecs
- maybe ~20 codecs for groups
- after a while, a phd student who graduates wants to take their phd and go to industry,
  the advisor will say "please deposit your data in the standard place"
- it should be something that takes an afternoon, or at most a week,
  and you can say "I don't need a new codec, i'll use the one by my supervisor"
- we hope to create a network effect where
  - the contribution cost is in the size of your contribution
  - the value effect is in the size of the network
- that's what we call "math data hub"

[Katja]
- Very hard to find datasets if you don't know the authors or their friends.
- Not uncommon to see say on stack overflow questions like "is there a database of xxx".
- To this end, I've started a list of databases
