Samuel
- with Katja, Erik, Michael T: shopped and picked up people
- opened issues in mathubinfo documentation repo issue tracker
  to suggest four more databases to include in mathdb.mathhub.info:
  - https://github.com/MathHubInfo/Documentation/issues/3
  - https://github.com/MathHubInfo/Documentation/issues/4
  - https://github.com/MathHubInfo/Documentation/issues/5
  - https://github.com/MathHubInfo/Documentation/issues/6
- didn't have the rights to tag the issues "math db"
- [Michael] anybody who needs rights, let me know
- created a wiki page for "graph software":
  https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/MathDataWorkshop/wiki/Graph-software
- with Julian last night, thought about the problem of building a polygon
  with prescribed angles; easy for convex polygon, less so if not;
  this is needed for the flatsurf / libflatsurf project
- this afternoon with Julian and remotely Vincent, weekly flatsurf call
- with Erik and Julian, worked on SageMath in Cygwin on Windows 7:
  - failing manifold doctests due to low-resolution time in Win7
    https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28365
  - failing padic doctests due to low-resolution time in Win7
    https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28366
- using Google Compute Platform Research Credits (obtained following
  Dima Pasechnik's example) and Julian's help, set up orchestrator vm
  on gcp for gitlab-ci runners to help with SageMath development
- forgot to enable the runners so they ran zero job
- with Erik and Julian, planned discussion on Python 3 and SageMath,
  has not happened yet

Odile
- I am Odile, I work with Nicolas in OpenDreamKit
- I work on visualisations of math objects on Jupyter, on Sage
- today I was happy to be introduced to math data
- discussion with Tom on the internals, database, query, schema
- discussion with Gabriel and Andrea, mostly listening
- so interaction from both sides which is really efficient, thank you

Tom
- talked with several people
- gave two demos
- many discussions with many people about what the system is,
  what they would like, what they are missing
- added two complete collections today:
  - they were given to me
  - they are completely insertable in the database
- on day 1, 1 collection was added;
  on day 2, 2 collections were added;

Michael
- most of my day: grant proposal writing sessionin Berlin,
  attended remotely
  - "mardi" = math research data initiative consortium
  - only reconciliation for those 5 hours of committee meeting
    is that we might get lots of money starting early next year,
    something like 3 M€ / year over 5 years, for math data,
  - unfortunately will be spent on things I'm not so interested in
  - 120 page proposal; using google docs... ugh

  [Erik] could be worse, I'm on a team where collaboration is by email with word documents

  - introduced Jukka and Gabe to formalization using MMT,
    to the point to turn them over to Dennis who's much
    better at formalizing

Florian
- introduced myself to Gabe today
- talked to other people
- fixed a couple of MMT bugs
- a bit behind on the release
- need to fix bugs I introduced

Julian
- talked a lot about polygons last night
- implemented serialisation to json for some library I'm working on

Michael
- first half of my day: obtaining + preparation of food
- second half: attack on mathematics, with two prongs
  - initial release of gap memoization package,
    which would be the analogue of pypersist
  - talked with Katja
    extraction
    big csv file, turned it into a big json file
    soon to be turned to a fairly small database
  - [Tom] I could have saved you time

Andrea
- set up the eye tracker, realized so far I had done this female thing
  of letting others set it up, 
- realized the math data hub is not working with Internet Explorer
- [Tom] works with Edge, not with Internet Explorer on Windows 7
- the eye tracker
- we have to update the license, which is ~5 k€
- this morning I realized I did have Internet Explorer on my computer
- I changed plans and actually started a paper prototype for the math data hub site
- Gabe was my first advanced user
- we found out quite nice things; you don't always need an eye tracker
- we discussed a lot with Gabe and Odile
- still have to write a summary of that and to discuss it with Katja
- I would like to point out that this paper prototype, even though it is so manual,
  actually that's on purpose: if you use a paper prototype, people are willing to
  criticise; if you've already put a lot of work in a website, people don't dare
- [Katja] overheard a bit, sounded like good ideas were flying
- [Katja] I think Samuel would be a good interviewee
- [Jukka] I usually have a lot of opinions about user interfaces

Jukka
- started my day by spamming everyone in my department about Katja's
  collection of databases
- Tom told me how to format the data
- we didn't put in lattices but something simpler: additive bases
- Tom has them in the database now
- all minimal additive bases, up to 25 elements
- we wrote a schema for them
- we went on to formalize those things with Dennis
- we have kind of a theory for additive bases
- i was introduced to wonderful things about MMT
- it seems a wonderful system for generalising everything to the absolute
- we even found some nice little bugs
- we ran into some ideas of removing unnecessary restrictions or assumptions
- we found the watermill and our way back

Dennis
- made acquaintance with Perl, don't think we are going to be good friends;
  this was not related to math data but to STeX
- [Michael] stex is our attempt to doing mmt in latex
- sat down with Jukka

Erik
- did not do anything especially fun or particularly related to math data
- worked with Samuel on Sage on Windows related issues
- discussed with Tom
- overheard many interesting things about codecs
- won't be there most of tomorrow but back on Wednesday
- love to do code review
 [Tom] I'll give you an overview on Wednesday

Gabe
- shuffled around some pieces of paper, which was a prototype
- regular abstract polyhedra
  - not all the properties I would like but good starting set of such things
- got walked thrhough some of the formalization stuff
- have a tentative plan for implementing edge-labeled graphs,
  then properly coloured edge-labeled graphs, then maniplexes,
  then polytopes, each being a subset of the one before
- I'm also working on producing a dataset that is a little broader
  than the one I have right now, but which people in my community like
  - what am I going to do with that dataset once I have it, I don't know

Katja
- talked a lot with Tom, and some with Florian
- went on a hike
- wrote up schema with Michael T and Gabe
- listened up on conversations
- I think we're doing pretty well for day 2
- hopes for tomorrow
  - add a subset of lattices
  - regular maniplexes whenever they happen
  - will try to do my part
  - pull in the symmetric graph things from my computer
  - would be great if some more formalization happens
  - would be nice to work on the missing codecs
- xxx it appears to be nice and they might be willing to share it

Tom
- one of the datasets only on my laptop
- the other one already on the website

Michael
- one thing I haven't seen yet, or only stubs of, is what is a collection,
  or what is a dataset
  - in particular, what are the kind of metadata people want to see about them
    - when was it started, who did it, what was done, why do we care
    - i heard things about codecs and interfaces, but not much about
      those things I'd want to know
Tom
- how long did it take to compute
- what is the license
- what kind of aggregated information

Katja
- what do I need to cite for the results to my query

Katja
- alpha deployment of math data hub is on mdhalpha.mathhub.info
  - please everybody have a look, click around, and complain a lot

Jukka
- a collection of something, vs the collection of all somethings
- [Gabe] like classification versus collection

Tom
- Return results to a query, with an english sentence,
  and "complete: True" and ...

Katja
- if you add this to your request, then it's actually complete

Jukka
- also we could look at the queries, "oh by the way there's a name
  for what you are looking for, it's called a geometric lattice"

Gabe
- along the lines of what is a collection, you might imagine
  - we have a collection of polytopes,
    and someone is only interested in
  - [Michael] "pinning" some filters
- ability to name the things with those filters applied
- [Katja] and probably ability to

Michael
- particularly interesting case of "complete" is when it has no element

Katja
- first progress report concluded, we've achieved a lot,
  feel proud of yourselves and continue talking

Katja
- we need a cook or chef for tomorrow lunch

Michael
- will go early buy bread
- 

After the status report: Tom, Katja, Florian, Julian, Erik discussed
requiring users to login, throttling for non-logged-in users, ...
