Michael Kohlhase explains to Samuel Lelièvre
his project of a multilingual mathematical glossary.

- it is semantic
- it is a glossary: has definitions for the objects
- written in a semantic variant of LaTeX called sTeX

Can run pdflatex over it, it gives you a pdf.

Currently

- no French

The pdf looks normal but has invisible semantic markup,
from which we can generate translations, glossaries, etc.

Mockup

https://beta.mathhub.info/applications/glossary?lang=en&language=en


For example, bijective has French (copied from the French wikipedia just to have something).


When you have something like this, you can also look at say the German version.

You need definitions which are semantic.

Demo

```
\begin{mhmodnl}[creators=miko]{naturalnumbers}{en}
\begin{definition}
The set $\NaturalNumbers$ of \defiis{natural}{number}
```

we have
- one signature
- variable number of semantic language bindings

Set NN of natural numbers


Would like to have sTeX localized in French.
This means having the keywords

github.com/slatex/stex


Then

    $ cd /opt/s/sTeX/sty/core/statements
    $ cp statements-finnish.ldf statements-french.ldf

    $ cd /opt/s/sTeX/sty/core/sproof
    $ cp sproof-finnish.ldf sproof-french.ldf

    $ cd /opt/s/sTeX/sty/core/problem
    $ 

    $ cd sTeX/sty/core
    $ DIR=statements

Glossary

SMGloM = semantic multilingual glossary of mathematics

- home: https://gl.mathhub.info/smglom
  - that's a gitlab server

- Translate definitions: defi, defii, defiii
- Term references: trefi, trefii, etc,
  - They reference defi's from other theories

$ git clone https://gl.mathhub.info/smglom/arithmetics
$ cp naturalnumbers.de.tex naturalnumbers.fr.tex

congruence.tex

- modsig = module signature
- imports: import stuff
- symbol definitions

for congruence we have modulo

naturalnumbers.tex

- modsig: module signature
- imports: we import set
- symdef: symbol definitions
  a symdef is a relatively powerful macro that generates
  what I call a semantic macro

- this here generates \NaturalNumbers
- with the presentation \mathbb{N}

When I write \NaturalNumbers, pdflatex sees `\mathbb{N}`
but if I generate content mathml, i get a math object,
in this case the object NaturalNumbers from the theory NaturalNumbers

A symbol may have both notation and verbalisation.

Eg here: verbalisation in german: Natürlichen Zahlen; notation: \mathbb{N}

That's what a glossary is supposed to do: keep a record of notations
and verbalisations in various languages.

----
Ambiguities exist.

Disambiguating is for mathematics not linguistics.


-----
For the glossary, there are 873 modules, with 1815 symbols,
referenced ~ 4000 times.

There is a "tools" package on github to generate the statistics.

One more thing

- symdef: for functions, eg the "successor" function

  \symdef[name=successor]{natsucc}[1]{\prefix\natsuccOp{#1}}

Example: Taylor series

- all the math formulae are written in semantic form.
