Jukka
- did some more data file conversions
- so we basically have 400k lattices
  (i have 11 billion of them if you want)
- had a hilarious session of looking at how you incorporate
  latex with semantics (stex) and I wrote something about
  additive bases in Finnish, and translated some other things
  to Finnish
- went on a hike
- talked with Katja about using Nauty and how graphs
  are being handled or can be handled
- started reading Katja's paper but got grabbed away

Katja
- any disastrous quick fixes before camera-ready version in 1.5 day
- more importantly, I would like this to grow into a real survey
  census journal thing
- [Nicolas] what kind of journal, for what readers?

Michael T
- talked with Jukka: visualisations of DiGraphs
- talked to Gabe, this confirms at least one person has
  now used the memoisation package, on Windows;
  it did not crash immediately
  - we used it to memoise a function (not Fibonacci)
    searching for quotients
  - that involved writing our own pickle function
  - it ended up working pretty good; it's now working
  - this confirms the package works on other people's computers,
    and on windows
- spoke to Nicolas about concurrency, how different threads
  could cache and make a mess
  - have a prototype for pypersist, the chances people will be
    multithreading GAP are not immense
    - [Nicolas] but multiprocessing; forks
  - should be done in GAP as well
  - that needs a few touches to it
- did a lock file thing, not a RAM thing

Florian
- spent time at LRI
- will program later tonight

Tom
- went over results of the interviews Andrea subjected 3 people to
- summarised the results with Andrea and Katja
- got down to a few keypoints
- met with Nicolas and Michael T regarding notebook search
  - search all juptyer notebooks on github
- implementation progress on some of the issues Andrea raised
- now have the state of the page in the url
- added descriptions to datasets
- added mathjax-style rendering (with KaTeX but mathjax-like)
-

Michael K
- semantic multilingual glossary of mathematics now has Finnish
  (almost as much Finnish as Turkish)
- learnt that Finnish inflects math symbols
- bike tour with Nicolas's tandem and Nicolas and Andrea
  and actually riding his tandem
- vertical detour turned out to be very aptly named
- very happy with the day

Dennis
- formalised 
  - wrote down type, and what definition should be
- did a little stex stuff; thought deeply

Odile
- prepared then had my interview with human resources
- the lady said she has computing background but did not
  know any of the languages I cited
- had a long nap at home, did small things in the house, came back
- set appointment with Albane for October to study her needs

Nicolas
- script to extract latex out of notebooks
- failed to use gitlab api to search for notebooks
- took care of reimbursements
- enjoyed bike ride
- talked about future funding

Gabe
- tortured various people and myself with a Windows machine
- got something working
- did a little work trying to generate more data;
  with limited success at the moment
  - now that i have memoisation in gap, sure to not redo stuff
- [Nicolas] that would be a usecase, cool

Andrea
- overwhelmed when I summarised all the three interviews
- got 47 points or so which I needed to explain or at least mention
  to Tom and Katja
- summarized that in an Excel worksheet; it's on the MathDataWorkshop repo
  so everyone can have a look
- formalised that in an issue in the GitHub repo; you can comment there
- tried to get all the opinions in there
- these are actually enough suggestions for now
  so did not do interviews with more people
- my plan is now to start a different prototype for the interaction
  selecting filters or conditions
  - click prototype
  - only started, because was then invited to a bike ride with a tandem
  - learned I have to trust my husband

Katja
- wrote conclusion that was missing
- community aspect of MathDataHub
- there are things that are important for the interface
  which we as developers cannot provide because domain-specific knowledge
  is necessary; and it might be unrealistic to require it from
  the database author
- languages: as soon as you want definitions in multiple languages...
- this is something we will need to consider in the future
- [Andrea] that's the further future but have to lay the ground now
- [Tom] my takeaway: implement it now
- [Gabe] do you want a gatekeeper for each dataset? for each language?
- the graph canonicalisation software tends to have a naughty interface;
  engineering help would be appreciated
  - things are well defined but on a technical level it is unfriendly

Samuel
- nothing to report; will do things tonight
